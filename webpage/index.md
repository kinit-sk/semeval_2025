## About the Task
<a id="abstract" />

The SemEval shared task on Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval addresses the critical challenge of efficiently identifying previously fact-checked claims across multiple languages — a task that can be time-consuming for professional fact-checkers even within a single language and becomes much more difficult to perform manually when the claim and the fact-check may be in different languages. Given the global spread of disinformation narratives, the range of languages that one would need to cover not to miss existing fact-checks is vast.

Participants in the task will develop systems to retrieve relevant fact-checked claims for given social media posts, using the MultiClaim dataset of over 200,000 fact-checked claims and 28,000 social media posts in 27 languages – supporting fact-checkers and researchers in their efforts to curb the spread of misinformation globally. Submissions will be evaluated in terms of two metrics, mean reciprocal rank and success-at-K and in two separate tracks: monolingual and crosslingual. The task not only pushes the boundaries of NLP and information retrieval, but it also has significant potential for real-world impact in the fight against misinformation.
